- HTML markup

- GitHub
- GitHub Pages

### What I learned

```css
:root {
    --clr-primary-Green: #c5f82a;
    
    --clr-neutral-white: #ffffff;
    --clr-neutral-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --clr-neutral-dark-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --clr-neutral-off-black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
```
I learnt how to set CSS variables  with custom components using the component properties that were given in the .README file

```html
<main class="wrapper">
    <div class="profile-container">
      <img src="assets/images/eyiram-black-and-white.jpg" alt="profile-photo" class="user-image">
      <h1 class="user-name">Eyiram Gaze</h1>
      <p class="user-location">Accra, Ghana</p>
      <p class="user-description">Problem-solver and passionate programmer</p>

      <ul class="social-links">
        <li><a href="https://github.com/egaze" class="list-item">GitHub</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/egaze" class="list-item">Frontend Mentor</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eyiram-gaze" class="list-item">LinkedIn</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://x.com/eyiram_g" class="list-item">Twitter / X</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://instagram.com/_gaze_e/" class="list-item">Instagram</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </main>
```
I also familiarized myself with structure with HTML files and containers with regards to linking them with the CSS file

### Continued development

I want to continue to create more projects and become more conversant with building in frontend using HTML and CSS. I'm also looking to start integrating frameworks like React.JS, as it significantly streamlines the development process and reflect the modern standards of web development, with more functionality.
